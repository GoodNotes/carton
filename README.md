# carton ðŸ“¦

`carton` is a watcher, bundler, and test runner for your SwiftWasm apps. The main goal of `carton`
is to provide the most smooth zero-config experience when developing for WebAssembly.
It is still in development, but it aims to support these features:

- Creation of new app packages built with SwiftWasm with `carton init`.
- Watching the app for source code changes and reloading it in your browser with `carton dev`.
- Running your XCTest suite in the full JavaScript/DOM environment with `carton test`.
- Optimizing and packaging the app for distribution with `carton dist`.

When using `carton` you don't have to install Node.js or to write your own webpack configs. `carton`
itself uses webpack as a dev dependency to precompile and minify the required WASI polyfill and the
reload-on-rebuild code, but you won't need webpack or Node.js when using carton as an end user.
The polyfill is distributed to you precompiled.

It is currently work in progress, so watch the repository for imminent updates!

# carton

`carton` is a watcher, bundler, and test runner for your SwiftWasm apps. The main goal of `carton` is to provide the most smooth zero-config experience when developing for WebAssembly.

When using `carton` you don't have to install Node.js or to write your own webpack configs.

It is currently work in progress, so watch the repository for imminent updates!
